## General info
Personal project which I made in order to help find cheapest Ryanair tickets, especially during ticket sales. It includes: 
1. Show cheapest fares from selected airport<br /> 	
2. Show all routes available from selected airport 
3. Show all fares for a specific route (with or without date range)<br /> 
4. Teleport – shows cheapest fares for a specific route (using airport codes or country codes) with a connecting point somewhere (with or without  date range) 
5. Teleport Return – shows cheapest fares for a specific return route (using airport codes or country codes) with a connecting point somewhere (with or without  date range and length of stay)
